<h3 align="center" id="aboutus"> ABOUT US </h3>
<p class="p3">Christian missionary activity came to Rayalaseema4
	region through London 
	Missionary Society (L.M.S), Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (S.P.G) 
	and American Baptist Mission (A.B.M). 
	The missionary activities of Ceded Districts dates back to the arrival of William Howell, 
	a surveyor of the Department of Public Works. He was stationed at Kadapa. This man spent his 
	leisure time in evangelizing the people. In course of time, Howell gathered a small congregation 
	in Kadapa town. Simultaneously, the London Missionary Society initiated a proposal to open a 
	Mission among the Telugu people. In 1822, therefore, they took over this congregation and 
	appointed Howell to be their resident missionary in the town. Two years later he was made a 
	regular minister of the congregation. L.M.S expanded their work to Nandyal, Jammalamadugu 
	and Gooty.5
	The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (S.P.G) mission started at 
	Cuddapah in 1849. It was in 1852 that the first conversion movement began when a Mala named 
	Nanchari from Rudravaram, a village north of Cuddapah, was caught stealing and jailed. He had 
	lived by selling thread in the daytime and stolen timber at night. In jail he heard the gospel 
	preached and on his release from prison he met the evangelist Alfred Wood who brought him to 
	the missionary Davies for Christian instruction. Because of this, other Malas from Nanchariâ€™s 
	village asked to become Christians with the result that in July 22nd, 1852, 30 people were 
	baptised at Rudravaram. Hearing of the change at Rudravaram, other villages followed them. </p>
